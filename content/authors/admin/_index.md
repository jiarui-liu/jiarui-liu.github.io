I am a 1st/3rd year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Language Technologies Institute. My research focuses on alignment and reasoning for large language models. I am advised by Professor [Mona Diab](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222228496/mona-diab) at CMU and work closely with Professor [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/home/) at the University of Toronto. I have completed internships at Amazon Rufus in Seattle in 2025, where I worked on honesty alignment for reasoning models; at Amazon AWS Bedrock in New York in 2024, where I studied multimodal hallucination; and at WarpEngine in Shanghai in 2023, where I built a personalized chatbot product.

Previously, I worked with Professors [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and Zhijing Jin in the [LIT group](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/index.html) at the University of Michigan on NLP for social good. I have also had a great time working with Professor [Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/) on improving the worst-group robustness.
